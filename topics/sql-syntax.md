# SQL Syntax

### SQL Statements

Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements.

SQL statements consist of keywords that are easy to understand.

The following SQL statement returns all records from a table named "Customers":

### Example

Select all records from the Customers table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

### Database Tables

A database most often contains one or more tables. Each table is identified by a name (e.g. "Customers" or "Orders"), and contain records (rows) with data.

In this tutorial we will use the well-known Northwind sample database (included in MS Access and MS SQL Server).

Below is a selection from the [**Customers**](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_customers) table used in the examples:

| CustomerID | CustomerName        | ContactName  | Address         | City   | PostalCode | Country |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ------ | ---------- | ------- |
| 1          | Alfreds Futterkiste | Maria Anders | Obere Str. 57   | Berlin | 12209      | Germany |
| 2          | Around the Horn     | Thomas Hardy | 120 Hanover Sq. | London | WA1 1DP    | UK      |

The table above contains five records (one for each customer) and seven columns (CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, and Country).

### Keep in Mind That...

- SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: `select` is the same as `SELECT`

In this tutorial we will write all SQL keywords in upper-case.

### Semicolon after SQL Statements?

Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.

Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.

In this tutorial, we will use semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.
